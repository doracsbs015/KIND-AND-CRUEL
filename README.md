🌼 Kind & Cruel - In a world where you can be anything, be most kind and least cruel to yourself.

Kind & Cruel is a full‑stack web application built with the intention of spreading **positivity, kindness, and gentle reminders** through words — while also being a hands‑on project to learn and ship a complete production‑ready system.

This project was designed, developed, and deployed end‑to‑end in **2 days**, covering real‑world concepts like authentication, CRUD operations, email systems, analytics, and deployment.

##💡 Why This Project?

I’ve always loved writing small notes and sharing kind words — sometimes with friends, sometimes with strangers. Over time, that habit faded. **Kind & Cruel** is my way of reviving that idea using technology.

At the same time, this project helped me:

* Learn and implement **full‑stack development**
* Understand **real‑world backend–frontend communication**
* Handle **authentication, email systems, and deployments**
* Build something meaningful, not just functional
